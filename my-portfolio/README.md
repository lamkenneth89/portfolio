# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built using the Strata template by HTML5 UP. It showcases my projects, skills, and contact information.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the portfolio, containing the structure of the website.
- **assets/css/main.css**: The stylesheet for customizing the look and feel of the portfolio.
- **assets/js/main.js**: JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the portfolio.
- **images/**: Contains images used in the portfolio, including my avatar and project images.

## Getting Started

To set up your own portfolio, follow these steps:

1. **Update `index.html`**: Modify the content to include your personal information, project descriptions, and links to your resume and project PDFs.
2. **Replace Images**: Update the images in the `images` folder with your own profile image and project images.
3. **Customize Styles**: Edit the `assets/css/main.css` file to match your personal branding and design preferences.
4. **Add JavaScript**: Implement any necessary functionality in the `assets/js/main.js` file.
